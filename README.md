The goal here is to create a coherent experience with vi bindings everywhere except in the browser!

> [!IMPORTANT]
> NeoVim is unconfigured.  
> Bring your own config!

## Installation
Start from an Arch, Void or Alpine Linux fresh installation system with functioning Xorg!  
Login as a standard user with `sudo` or `doas`(with shim) properly configured.

> [!NOTE]
> On Alpine Linux you need to be on [edge](https://alpinelinux.org/posts/2025-10-01-usr-merge.html) and have testing [repositories](https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/Repositories) enabled!  
> On Arch Linux `dk` will be cloned and compiled meaning the scripts will install `base-devel`

1. Clone the repo and run the installer
```sh
git clone https://github.com/sansneo/prime
cd prime
sh installer.sh arch/void/alpine
```
2. Go over installed dotfiles and tweak them

> [!TIP]
> For the VSCode config you need the GitHub Themes and Vim extension installed  
> It's highly recommended to use uBlock Origin and a password manager like Bitwarden in Firefox

3. Done ðŸŽ‰

## Keybindings
